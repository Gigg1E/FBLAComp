# Local Website Review README.md File

### How to run
I have created a .bat script that will create the enviornment for you and send you streight to the website.
File name is **RUN-THIS.bat** located in the same folder as this **README.md**.

## Issues
If you come across any issues during install you might have to setup the enviornment manually. Don't worry, I can walk you through the steps.
Before taking any steps to manually install, please know what is failing. The **RUN-THIS.bat** may or may not tell you what the problem is.

### Basic issues you might see
- You may get a warning that you can't run scripts. This is defaulted to _OFF_ of computers with Windows 11 installed but can be turned on without admin permisson (unless its a restricted computer like those for students) - see the section about Enabling Scripts
- NPM/Node.js may not be installed. If it crashes at this phase you need to manually install. NOTE: It has a step to install NPM and Node.js so wait and see if it fails to install - See NPM/Node.js install

### Things you need
To start the website there are some things you have to have installed on you computer to run the backend software.
These items include **Node.js** and **NPM** (both come in the same install package). You can download here https://nodejs.org/en/download
> You only need to do this if the **RUN-THIS.bat** fails
